akrgis.nps.gov Website
======================

## home

This is the old, and quite lame, home page from the original FEMP
server (c2014).  At that point we were experimenting with various
web mapping services, including Geocortex, flexviewer, silverlight,
and ArcGIS Server, among others.  The home page was
largely a list of links to several demonstration apps, the
underlying services, and documentation on how to create
similar apps. Eventually all these technologies went by the
wayside, or at least were trumped by ArcGIS Online and Portal.
Almost all the links on the home page are broken and long since dead.
This home page has been hidden by a redirection to an esri gallery
app on the NPS Portal which showcases a number of web maps. 

I would like to replace this home page with a clean modern
web page with descriptions (and links) to the various apps
offered on the web site, as well as to galleries on both AGOL
and Portal.  Stay tuned.
