akrgis.nps.gov Website
======================

## home

This is the old, and quite lame, home page from the original FEMP
server (c2014).  At that point we were experimenting with various
web mapping services, including Geocortex, flexviewer, silverlight,
ArcGIS Server, among others.  The home page was
largely a list of links to several demonstration apps, the
underlying services, and dcoumentation on how to create other
similar apps. Eventually all these technologies wet by the
wayside, or at least were trumped by ArcGIS Online and Portal.
This home page has been hidden by a redirection to a esri gallery
app on the NPS Portal, showcasing a number of web maps.  Almost all
the links on the home page are broken and long since dead.

I would like to replace this home page with a clean modern
web site with descriptions (and links) to the various apps
offerd on the web site, as well as to galleries on both AGOL
and Portal.
